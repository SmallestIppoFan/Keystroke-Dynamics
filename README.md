# Keystroke-Dynamics
Keystroke Dynamics
Keystroke Dynamics is an innovative Python-based project that focuses on user authentication. It leverages the PyQt5 library for its graphical interface and offers a unique approach to security by using keystroke dynamics for user identification.

Features
User Registration and Login: The source code provides the functionality for standard user registration and login. Users can create an account by entering their username and password.

Keystroke Dynamics Recording: The unique feature of this project is the implementation of keystroke dynamics for authentication. When a user registers, the program records the unique characteristics of their typing style, such as the speed and rhythm of key presses.

Keystroke-based Authentication: Upon login, the program compares the user's current keystroke dynamics with the one recorded during registration. If they do not match, access to the account will be denied. This adds an extra layer of security, helping to prevent unauthorized access even if the password has been compromised.

Technologies
Python: A general-purpose programming language used for developing the core logic of the application.

PyQt5: A library for creating the graphical user interface, providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary Python packages and dependencies.
Run the main Python script to start the application.
Register by creating a new account.
Log in using your credentials. Remember, the program will be analyzing your keystroke dynamics for authentication.
Keystroke Dynamics is a leap forward in security, offering an innovative and effective method of user authentication. Developers interested in contributing to this project, please feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests. For any issues, use the GitHub issue tracker.
